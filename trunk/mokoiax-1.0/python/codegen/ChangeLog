	* ctypes_codegen\codegenerator.py: Added a USE_COMMENTS variable
	which allows to turn comment generation off.  Generated
	'_anonymous_' declarations for unnamed structure fields.

	Changed the way libraries are loaded, the cdecl and stdcall
	decorators are no longer used.  Functions are generated with
	assignments of .restype and .argtypes.:

	* ctypes_codegen\codegenerator.py: When generating the '__all__' list,
	don't break long strings.

	* h2xml does no longer create a file named 'None' when no output
	file was given on the command line.

	* Added a TODO list.

	* Initial import of the current ctypes codegenerator version.
